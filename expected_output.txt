Espionage is the formal word for spying In the shadowy 
world of spies, international organizations use brilliant 
spies to infiltrate powerful groups for purpose of obtaining 
top-secret information 
For example, spies might have to crack the code for accessing 
sensitive files. Sometimes the missions are far more 
dangerous like stealing the key ingredient for making the award-winning 
"Explosive apple pie", invented by Germans 
Spies are found the world over in places like markets 
but they are not allowed to reveal their real identities. 
spy may be anyone includuing celebrities like rock and even the 
little old lady with grey hair and the pet cat 
The world of spying might seem glamorous and fun but it's filled 
with unimaginable risks and large rewards! Sure, spies get to carry super-cool devices 
like a laser-gun but they can't trust anyone. That's why the number 
one rule for spies is "keep your friends close and your 
enemies closer!".
